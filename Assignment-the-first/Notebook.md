	First I decided to "head" each file to see what they all looked like. Looks like they are all fastq files and all have the same headers except for the tabbed over section e.g. "1:N:0:1". The files are named differently as follows: 1:N:0:1, 2:N:0:1, 3:N:0:1, 4:N:0:1, respectively.

	✧ All files have the same number of lines: 1452986940
	✧ R1 and R4 have read length of 101bps and R2 and R3 have length of 8bps
	✧ The phred encoding for this data is Phred33 encoding. I can determine this by looking at the phred scores in some of the data files and calculating the phred scores, either phred33 or phred64. I can use a lower score and subtract either 33 or 64 from it and if the quality score is a negative number, then I know to use phred33.
